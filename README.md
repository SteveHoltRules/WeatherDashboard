# WeatherDashboard

During this project I learned more about the details of arranging a bootstrap file using a sidebar as card/tiles. I built the tiles using a loop to distribute the information from the API call to the tiles. The growth from this project came from approaching each aspect in turn, listing changes to pursue, and narrowing the focus around that item until it was refined to the point where I am happy at the progress and can more on to the next item. While this is not an exhaustive list of the issues to tackle over the course of this project, it does contain some of the later issues.
