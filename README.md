# WeatherDashboard

During this project I learned more about the details of arranging a bootstrap file using a sidebar as card/tiles. I built the tiles using a loop to distribute the information from the API call to the tiles. The growth from this project came from approaching each aspect in turn, listing changes to pursue, and narrowing the focus around that item until it was refined to the point where I am happy at the progress and can more on to the next item. While this is not an exhaustive list of the issues to tackle over the course of this project, it does contain some of the later issues. 

1. Setup Bootstrap
2. Setup Bootstrap sidebar
3. Setup page icon
4. Setup Bootstrap Tiles
5. API Call for main section
6. API Call for tile icons
7. API Call for forecast
8. Clear the string after clicking the function
9. Clear out the prior search information
10. Pass the city and the state into the api
11. Clean-up and display more information on the 5 day forecast
12. Make the static links function
13. Use localstorage to set and get data
14. Update the search to dynamically change the buttons
15. Add UV color coding
16. Add Icon to main and center the formatting
17. Save searches to local storage
15. Post searches to button menu
16. Persist local storage button information on reload

1. Use more local storage functionality - Allow the user to select the top 5 cities of keep on the daskboard.
2. Set the Forecast API to use a time of day (noon for example) instead of pre-selecting the data-streams (in this case, the 4 stream, and every 8 after that for the same time period the following day).
